# PizzaPatentAnalysis

In this project, open source patent data on pizza-related patents (from the World
Intellectual Property Organization), along with other necessary datasets (eg: country
population dataset) were gathered, processed, and then analysed using the
programming language Python, data manipulation and visualisation libraries like
pandas, seaborn & matplotlib. The analysis was done in the data-analysis environment
provided by Jupyter notebooks.
